# Article-Sentiment-Analysis

Simple sentiment analysis program that works by checking the frequency of "positive" and "negative" words in an article. Uses web scraping to extract article content, best optimized for Yahoo Finance articles but can easily be tailored to accomodate other platforms. The program then visualizes the results through a pie chart.
